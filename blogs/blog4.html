                                    <blockquote class="text-center"><strong>“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it” <br><span class="float-right">– Warren Buffett</span></strong></blockquote>
                                    <br><br> Social media has deeply penetrated our lives. Staying in touch with friends and relatives has surely become easier because of it. However, they are also a breeding ground for potentially libelous statements
                                    and stuff. The social media platforms have enabled people, even introverts, to speak and socialize freely. The internet is overflowed with a plethora of interesting websites where someone could intentionally or accidentally
                                    leave a comment or post which might be defamatory. The Indian Legislature doesn’t provide the exact definition of Online Defamation in any statute, even in the Information Technology Act, 2000; which deals with cybercrime
                                    . However, in general, the term online defamation means publishing defamatory material against another person with the help of computers or the internet.
                                    <br><br> But the word “defamation” is defined under section 499 of IPC, 1860 as <i>words spoken or intended to be read to cause harm to a person and believes or has a reason to believe that it will cause harm to the reputation of such person.</i>                                    The punishment prescribed for such an act is imprisonment up to two years, or fine, or both. For defamatory social media posts and innuendo comments, such publication must be of a certain degree that again stands to
                                    the test of ordinary prudence which is indeed subjective. Moreover in cases related to defamation done by public authorities, one can directly approach the Supreme Court and the High Court for violation of the fundamental
                                    right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 32 and Article 226 of the Indian Constitution.
                                    <br><br> Before the honorable Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the landmark case of Shreya Singhal vs Union of India and struck down the Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 that provides punishment
                                    for sending offensive messages through communication services.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Global Removal of Content, Indian Courts & its Jurisdiction</h3>
                                    In the case of Swami Ramdev v. Facebook & Ors , Swami Ramdev approached the Delhi High Court for the removal of defamatory content against him from various websites including Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. It is claimed that the defamatory sentences
                                    were made concerning remarks, videos, and other types of content related to a book named “Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev.”
                                    <br><br> The Delhi High Court passed an order to block the defamatory content worldwide. In this order the court further clarified that geo-blocking of substance in India doesn't limit the Indian users from getting
                                    to the said content as the same is easily accessible through virtual private systems, intermediary servers, and so forth. In like manner the above court issue concerns, the people living in India only that is the reason
                                    it falls under their jurisdiction and even notices Section 79 of the IT Act, 2000 to account its position. Also the court even stated that the platforms are specialized and sound enough to bring down such content or
                                    material worldwide as they follow their local community rules and terms of usage. In its judgment, the court has stated that “It is not unknown that the Canadian, European and American websites of Google, Facebook,
                                    YouTube, and Twitter can be accessed in India through various technological means. This would thus result in partial disabling and partial removal.”

                                    <h3>Can one sue an internet service provider, if such publications are made on their Platforms?</h3>
                                    Yes, one can sue ISP’s for causing such damage to reputation or public image but only if they have done such damage intentionally, they are given exemption under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 as they are intermediaries and just provide
                                    their services to third parties only.
                                    <br><br> In the case of Google India Private Limited v. M/S Vishakha Industries , the coordinator of Ban Asbestos India group wrote a piece against Vishakha Industries which injured the company’s reputation. As Google
                                    India was hosting a group on its Google Group services that’s why it was made a party to this case. Google India contended that intermediaries such as Google Inc., which is a service provider, providing a platform for
                                    end-users to upload content, does not amount to publication in law and consequently, the question of holding such intermediaries liable for defamation does not arise and it is being protected by exemption given to intermediaries
                                    in Section 79 of IT Act, 2000.
                                    <br><br> According to Hon’ble court, the service provider (Google ) made such publication easily available to the users at large on the internet and hence leads to its spread, without taking any due care as M/S Vishakha
                                    Industries issued legal notice asking Google India to take down such a derogatory statement. The court took note of the earlier version of Section 79 in its judgment, bringing liability on Google India by stating that
                                    this exemption would not be available to pre-2009 cases, especially defamation cases. However, after the amendment in Section 79 of the Act, intermediaries are provided comprehensive protection to any liability arising
                                    from publications or information made available by it. The purpose to provide an exemption of liability helps the intermediary to operate without any intervention.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Analysis of Present Law</h3>
                                    A critical evaluation of the case-law referred to above, makes it profusely clear that the operation of global networks and the concept of quasi-physical territory associated with the cyber world, call upon the need for a new legal perspective and pragmatic
                                    approach in handling cyber-related crimes by the judiciary.
                                    <br><br> The courts while adjudicating on cyber cases no longer adhere to strictly rigid and literal interpretation of the law but adopt a more pragmatic and practical approach to the problems involved in the case before
                                    them for disposal, without, however, deviating from the basic intent of the legislature in enacting the law applicable to the need of the time, therefore, is that the judiciary should move faster than the cybercriminals
                                    by expediting disposal of cyber cases within a time-frame and make sure that the guilty do not escape punishment due to vagaries of law and evidence.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3>Concluding Notes</h3>
                                    We can witness judicial activism regarding cyber defamation. The service provider (like Google, Facebook, etc.) has made it easier to publicize the defamatory statements to the worldwide audience over the Internet. So far freedom of speech is concerned
                                    which is guaranteed under article 19(a) of the Constitution of India it comes with few measures which include speaking against public order, decency or morality, and defamation. We have entered an era of modernization,
                                    technology, and internet where :
                                    <br><br>
                                    <blockquote class="text-center"><strong>“Words speak louder than actions”.</strong></blockquote>
                                    We need to be very careful while writing or posting something on the internet as such things can bring grave liability to the users. But still, there is dire need to have a crystal clear law on cyber defamation as the judicial activism leads to judgments
                                    in conflict with the law and delay in getting justice, which means justice delayed is justice denied.
